# Immobility, a code smell
This note aims to outline immobility as it relates to software development, specifically [agile design](./agile-design.md).

Immobility is a code smell (AKA symptom of poor software design) that's characterised by:
- High risk and effort involved in extracting portions of code into independent modules

There might be portions of code that'd be useful in other software, but the risk of extracting them into independent modules is too great, and the effort of doing so is too high.
