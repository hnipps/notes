# Fragility, a code smell
This note outlines fragility as it relates to software devlopment, particularly [Agile Design](./agile-design.md).

Fragility is a code smell (AKA symptom of poor software design) that's characterised by:
- Code that breaks in many places when a single change is made
- Unexpected issues arising in areas unrelated to the one being changed
- Modules that tend to get worse the more they're "fixed"
