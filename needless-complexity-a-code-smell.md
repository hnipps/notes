# Needless Complexity, a code smell
This note aims to outline Needless Complexity as it related to software development, specifically [agile design](./agile-design.md).

Needless complexity is a code smell (AKA symptom of poor software design) that's characterised by:
- Inclusion of elements that aren't currently used
- Preparation for future changes that may not materialise
