# Psycho Cybernetics

## Chapter 2


## Chapter 3
This chapter was about mental visualisation. I should practice this for 30 mins every day. Mentally picture what it is I want to achieve, the state that I want to be in.

Pro tip: notice the details in your visualisations, e.g. smell of antisepctic, dentist's perfectly manicured hands.
