# Design Systems
> > "A design system is a living, funded product with a roadmap and backlog, serving an ecosystem." - Nathan Curtis, Principle & Founder of EightShapes

A design system can incorporate many different artifacts, including:
- Styleguide
- Design language
- Visual language
- Pattern library
- Brand guidelines
- Voice and tone

Notes:
- Not a 'write and done' effort, it's living, continuously changing and evolving
- Needs a clear measurable path for success
- Needs people/products to use it
- The design system must allow users, outside the design systems team, to implement it independently


When do you need a design system?
- NOT for small teams
- When you have scale and stability
- Remove knowledge siloes (bus factor)
- Consistency across products/platforms
- Redline spec interpretation
  - Developers may not interpret a spec in the way intended by designers
- Reduce implementation decisions - decisions about the design, style, layout etc. have already been made
- Reduce waste
  - Fewer redline specs and less documentation
  - The design system documentation should be enough, and there's only 1 set of redline specs

Byproducts of a design system:
- Definied principles
- Minimised duplication
- Cross-team empathy
- Reduce cost of building software

Selling a design system:
- Tradeoffs
  - Time spent on design system means less time spent on new features
- Organizational challenges (funding, structure, decision-makers)

Pros of design system:
For Devs:
- Less time deciding what UI to use
- Less time refactoring code
  - Using components reduces this, only need to refactor the component file, not every single instance
- More consistency in implementation methods
  - Point out inconsistencies in products

For Business:
- Make money - provide a better CX
  - Improve CX/UX
  - Inconsistent experiences = consequence for user
- Save money
  - Show time spent rewriting logic and UI - reduced by design system
    - This time will increase at scale


Four stages of a design system:
- Seed
  - When you start deciding to build the system
  - Pain of not using a design system starts to show
- Discovery - start of first diamond
  - Conduct research, collaborate across disciplines, start to understand system scope
- Framing - convergence of first diamond
  - Start to converge on scope, priority, strategy and technology
  - Goal is to have a clear realistic path to implementation
  - Start thinking about how to deliver the system to users
- Solution
  - Start to build and continuously test


Questions?
- Is a design system fragile?
  - Increasing efficiency can increase fragility
  - When is it appropriate to use?
    - I think this is why you shouldn't build a design system at a small, new company. The company must be stable.
